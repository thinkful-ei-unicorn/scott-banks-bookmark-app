# Thinkfull Bookmark App [:books:](https://ebonrul.github.io/HelloWorld/bookmark.html) #
As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

- :heavy_check_mark: title
- :heavy_check_mark: url link
- :heavy_check_mark: description
- :heavy_check_mark: rating (1-5)

- :heavy_check_mark: I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
- :heavy_check_mark: All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
- :heavy_check_mark: I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
- :heavy_check_mark: Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
- :heavy_check_mark: I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
- :heavy_check_mark: I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
- :heavy_check_mark: Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
- :heavy_check_mark: I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
- :heavy_check_mark: (Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
